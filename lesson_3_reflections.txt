Manual vs. automatic pull
You would want to pull changes manually so that your code always behaves as you expect it.
If git is pulling in updates automatically it may not only overwrite changes you've made, 
but it may also make changes to your code that you won't be aware of.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. when would you use one instead of the other?
Forks are git to git copies of a repository.
A clone is a local copy of a repository.
A branch is a variation of a repository.
