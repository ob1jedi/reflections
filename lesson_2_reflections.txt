what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	So that git knows that there is a repository there.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a temporary location which allows you to bundle your changes by logical updates, 
	and then commit each bundle of updates at once.
